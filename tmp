## How I wrote bacionejs on Android
[Bacione Javascript Editor](https://github.com/bacionejs/editor) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming small javascript games on a phone. Several games are included.

I used the Neovim editor to create the Bacionejs editor. Below is my setup.

## Installed
- [termux](https://github.com/termux)
- apache
- neovim
- conquer of completion

## Which Editor to Use for Programming on a Phone/Tablet Offline?

There are several editors available on the Play Store, but **Termux** combined with **Neovim** stands out as the superior choice. However, vim motions aren’t optimized for typing with a **thumb**.

To address this issue, I created **[bacionejs](https://github.com/bacionejs/editor)**, which is designed specifically for programming small JavaScript games on mobile devices offline. For more extensive programming tasks, Neovim remains the recommended option.

## Unexpected Keyboard

### ⚠️ Beware
- My top row contains **Neovim mappings**.  
  For example, `S` is actually `<space>S` (where `<space>` is the leader key).  
  This mapping triggers `:w` (save). You’ll likely want to remove these mappings.
- I no longer use this keyboard, so you won’t find these mappings in my current `init.vim`.
